Portfolio Building
If you have any ideas youâ€™d like to build as your website give the detailed information to your instructor and start working on it. It should include all the different HTML, CSS, SASS and JS functionalities we learned in class and standard web components.  

Otherwise, work on the idea given by your instructor.   

This project is group work. Each group should have up to 4 members. Once it is done it should be published on 000webhost service and uploaded on the d2l final project dropbox as a zip file.

This website can be a valuable way to show your qualifications and portfolio to
